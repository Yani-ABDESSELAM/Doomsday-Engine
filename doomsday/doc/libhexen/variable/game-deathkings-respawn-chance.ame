@summary{
    In Deathkings of the Dark Citadel, ACS script 255 will periodically 
    respawn more monsters into the map. This variable specifies the
    chance of respawning as a percentage. For example:
    @list{
        @item 100 means all respawns occur normally (as in the original game).
        @item 75 means 25% of the respawns will randomly be cancelled. 
        @item 0 means respawns are disabled.
    }
}
