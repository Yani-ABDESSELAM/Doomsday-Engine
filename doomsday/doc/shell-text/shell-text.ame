@chapter{ Introduction }

The Shell is a utility for controlling and monitoring Doomsday servers. It has
a curses-based terminal-friendly UI that allows one to connect to local and
remote Doomsday servers. One can also start new servers on the local machine.

Once connected to a server, a console command line is provided for controlling
the server.


@chapter{ User Interface }

@section { Menu }

Press @kbd{F9}, @kbd{^C}, or @kbd{^Z} to open the menu.

@deflist{

@item{Connect to...} Open a connection to a server at a given IP address.

@item{Disconnect} Disconnect the current connection. The server will not be
stopped.

@item{Start local server} Starts a new Doomsday server on the local machine. A
dialog will open for configuring the game mode, server's TCP port, and other
launch options. You must ensure that Doomsday will be able to locate the
required @wikilink{IWAD files}{IWAD}. After the server launches, a connection
to it is opened automatically.

@item{Scroll to bottom} Scrolls the log entry history down to the bottom of the
buffer, to the latest received log entry.

@item{About} Information about the Shell utility.

@item{Exit} Exit the Shell. Any running servers will not be stopped.

}

@section { Console }

A console command line is provided for interacting with a connected server.
These commands will get you started:

@deflist{
    @item{@cmd{help}}
        Show some general level help about using the console interface.
    @item{@cmd{apropos}}
        Look up commands and variables containing a specific word.
}

The @kbd{PageUp} and @kbd{PageDown} keys scroll the log entry history.
